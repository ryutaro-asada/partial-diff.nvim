A Neovim plugin for performing partial diffs on selected code regions with advanced character-level diff highlighting powered by VSCode's diff algorithm.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Partial Diff**: Compare any two selected regions of code

## Installation

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
  {
    "ryutaro-asada/partial-diff.nvim",
  },
```

### Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
  'ryutaro-asada/partial-diff.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('partial-diff').setup()
  end
}
```
## Configuration

```lua
require('partial-diff').setup({
  -- Debug options
  debug = false,
  -- Highlight customization
  highlights = {
    -- Link to existing highlight groups
    line_change = 'DiffChange',
    line_add = 'DiffAdd',
    line_delete = 'DiffDelete',
    -- Specify custom colors
    char_add = {
      bg = '#2d5a2d',   -- Background color
      fg = '#a9dc76',   -- Foreground color
      bold = true,      -- Bold
      italic = false,   -- Italic
      underline = false -- Underline
    },
    char_delete = {
      bg = '#5a2d2d',
      fg = '#ff6188',
    },
    char_change = {
      bg = '#4a4a0e',
      fg = '#ffd866',
      bold = true
    }
  }
})
```

### VSCode Diff Algorithm (Optional but Recommended)

For better character-level diff highlighting, install the VSCode diff algorithm:

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system
2. Run `:PartialDiffInstallVSCode` in Neovim
3. This will install the required npm packages in the plugin directory

Without this, the plugin will fall back to Neovim's built-in diff.

## Commands

### Primary Commands

- `:PartialDiffFrom` - Mark a range of lines as the source (what you're diffing from)
- `:PartialDiffTo` - Mark a range of lines as the target (what you're diffing to) and display the diff
- `:PartialDiffDelete` - Close the current diff view
- `:PartialDiffInstallVSCode` - Install VSCode diff algorithm dependencies

### Legacy Commands (Backward Compatibility)

- `:PartialDiffA` - Alias for `:PartialDiffFrom`
- `:PartialDiffB` - Alias for `:PartialDiffTo`

### Debug Commands

- `:PartialDiffShowLog` - Show the debug log file
- `:PartialDiffClearLog` - Clear the debug log file

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Select the first range of lines in visual mode
2. Execute `:PartialDiffFrom` (or use your keymap)
3. Select the second range of lines in visual mode
4. Execute `:PartialDiffTo` (or use your keymap)
5. View the diff in a new tab with side-by-side comparison

### Example

```vim
" Select lines 10-20 in visual mode
:'<,'>PartialDiffFrom

" Select lines 30-40 in visual mode
:'<,'>PartialDiffTo

" Close the diff when done
:PartialDiffDelete
```

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.10.0 or later
- (Optional) Node.js for VSCode diff algorithm
